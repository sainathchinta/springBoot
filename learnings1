4 important concepts in springboot

Inversion of Control (IoC): IoC is like giving the keys of your car to someone else and letting them drive. In Spring,
IoC means giving control of object creation and management to the framework, so you can focus on writing business logic.

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP): AOP helps you tackle common tasks that cut across different parts of your application,
like logging or security. By separating these concerns, your code becomes more organized and easier to maintain.

Spring MVC: Spring MVC is like having a personal assistant for handling web requests. It takes care of mapping URLs 
to controllers and generating web pages, so you can focus on building your applicationâ€™s functionality.

Spring Data: Spring Data is like having a magic wand for working with databases. It provides a unified interface for
interacting with different types of databases, saving you time and effort.



@SpringApplication

contains 3 annotations

1.@Autoconfiguration: this tells the spring to create the beans instead of user creating manually which are added in dependencies
2.@ComponentScan is an annotation that tells Spring where to look for annotated components, such as @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller. 
When Spring's application context starts up, it will automatically discover and register these components as beans.
3.@onfiguration: Marks the class as a configuration class, a source of bean definitions.
